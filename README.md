## bookReviewWebProject
#Project Overview/Introduction:-

This project “Book Review Website” is a full stack website covering the front end and back end technologies. In this project we provided the user a platform where they are able to register for our website and then log in using their Email and password.
Once the user logged in they can search  for a particular book from the handpicked 5000 books database through book’s ISBN, Author Name and Title. They will be able to give their reviews and star rating to the book they like and can also checks the ratings and reviews by other users of the website so that they can know the feedbacks of the books by the other users. Added with these the user can also make changes to their profiles, can edit the review any time and delete it too.
The project also includes an API. When calls to the API are made, using an ISBN number, users will be able to access details about the relevant book.
